I need to create a new microservice domain in our Refuge House multi-microservice platform. 

**Context:**
- We have a monorepo structure with `packages/shared-core/` containing all foundational utilities
- The existing "home-visits" microservice is the reference implementation
- All shared functionality (auth, db, permissions, components, etc.) is in `@refugehouse/shared-core/*`
- Each microservice is configured via `lib/microservice-config.ts` and environment variables
- Access control uses microservice-specific roles and permissions stored in the database

**New Microservice Details:**
- Microservice Code: [YOUR_MICROSERVICE_CODE] (e.g., "case-management", "service-plan", "training")
- Display Name: [YOUR_DISPLAY_NAME] (e.g., "Case Management System", "Service Plans", "Training Management")
- Description: [YOUR_DESCRIPTION]
- Base URL Path: [YOUR_BASE_PATH] (e.g., "/case-management", "/service-plans", "/training")

**Required Features:**
[List your specific features/requirements here]
- Example: Dashboard, CRUD operations for [entity], reporting, etc.

**Roles Needed:**
[List roles, e.g., "case_manager", "case_worker", "case_viewer"]
- Or use standard roles: manager, coordinator, worker, viewer

**Permissions Needed:**
[List permissions, e.g., "view_cases", "create_cases", "edit_cases", "delete_cases"]
- Or use standard permissions: view, create, edit, delete, generate_reports, etc.

**Navigation Structure:**
[List navigation items with URLs, icons, and order]
- Example:
  - Dashboard (/dashboard) - Home icon, order 1
  - Cases (/cases) - FileText icon, order 2
  - Reports (/reports) - BarChart3 icon, order 3
  - Admin (/admin) - Settings icon, order 4

**Please:**
1. Review the existing microservice structure in `lib/microservice-config.ts` and the home-visits implementation
2. Review the microservice creation guide at `docs/microservice-creation-guide.md`
3. Review the shared-core reference at `docs/shared-core-reference.md`
4. Create the microservice configuration following the established patterns
5. Set up the initial database SQL scripts (microservice registration, navigation items, permissions)
6. Create the basic page structure and routes
7. Ensure all imports use `@refugehouse/shared-core/*` aliases
8. Use `AccessGuard` component for route protection
9. Follow the same patterns as the home-visits microservice for consistency

**Key Files to Reference:**
- `lib/microservice-config.ts` - Microservice configuration pattern
- `app/(protected)/layout.tsx` - Layout with AccessGuard
- `app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Dashboard example
- `packages/shared-core/components/access-guard.tsx` - Access control component
- `packages/shared-core/lib/user-management.ts` - User and permission management
- `docs/microservice-creation-guide.md` - Complete creation guide
- `docs/shared-core-reference.md` - Shared utilities reference

**Important:**
- All database operations must use `@refugehouse/shared-core/db`
- All authentication must use `@refugehouse/shared-core/auth`
- All permission checks must use `@refugehouse/shared-core/permissions`
- All UI components should use `@refugehouse/shared-core/components/ui/*`
- Navigation should be loaded from database via `@refugehouse/shared-core/app/api/navigation/route.ts`
- Follow the same file structure and naming conventions as home-visits

**Testing Workflow:**
- ⚠️ **ALL TESTING IS DONE IN REMOTE ENVIRONMENTS (Vercel deployments)**
- No local testing is performed
- Deploy to Vercel and test in preview/production environment
- All validation and testing happens in remote deployments

Please create this microservice following our established patterns and best practices.
